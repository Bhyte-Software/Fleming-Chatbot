As long as the stinger remains in the skin, it keeps pulsating and injecting more venom. So first, gently remove
the stinger. Try not to squeeze it as you do this.
Next, wash the sting area. This will remove some of the venom. After this, apply damp charcoal to pull out more venom. 
A paste of baking soda and water will help neutralize the toxins. 
Cold compresses or ice cubes will help reduce pain still more.
If you show dizziness, difficulty in breathing, severe swelling or hives, contact a physician.
